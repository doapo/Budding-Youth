        Mental health is just as important as physical health, yet too many students struggle in silence due to a lack of support in our schools. It's time to change that.

        We are calling on all students, parents, educators, and community members to join us in advocating for improved mental health support in schools. Our youth deserve access to resources and services that promote emotional well-being and provide assistance when needed.
